what is loop?

Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, and they allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. In Python, there are two primary types of loops: "for" and "while."

for loop: 
when a definate time a code will executed, use for loop
while: when no definate time, use while loop.

Difference between break and continue
Break: in break print output will break when find the break value.
continue: continue to next value after skiping match value and show output.
